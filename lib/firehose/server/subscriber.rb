        #       whenever a deferrable was 'subscribed' we could instantly fail
        #       the deferrable with whatever connection error we had.
        #       An alternative which would have a similar result would be to
        #       subscribe lazily (i.e. not until we have a deferrable to subscribe).
        #       Then, if connecting failed, it'd be super easy to fail the deferrable
        #       with the same error.
        #       The final goal is to allow the failed deferrable bubble back up
        #       so we can send back a nice, clean 500 error to the client.
